## Getting Started

This Android app is written in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org), a JVM language that is more expressive and concise. Opening the project in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) is recommended for its native Kotlin support. In case you have never used Kotlin, [here](https://medium.com/@juanchosaravia/learn-kotlin-while-developing-an-android-app-introduction-567e21ff9664) is a great article to get you familiar with it.

*Note: In order to build the app, you need to set your own API keys (as `string` resources).*
